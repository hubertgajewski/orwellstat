description: Review staged and unstaged changes against the project's code review checklist.
---

Run `git diff HEAD` to see all changes, then work through every item in the checklist below. For each item, explicitly state a finding: **pass**, **fail** (with the specific problem), or **N/A** (with the reason it does not apply). Saying "no issues" without articulating what was checked is not acceptable.

Also apply the general diff checks and (if `.github/workflows/*.yml` files changed) the CI workflow checks from the **"Review the diff as a fresh reviewer"** step in `.claude/skills/fix-issue/SKILL.md`.

After completing all checks, provide a summary: total pass / fail / N/A counts and a prioritised list of any failures that must be fixed before committing.

## Code review checklist

Before committing changes to `playwright/typescript`, review against these criteria:

- **Playwright test correctness** — selectors use `getByRole()` / `getByText()` with `exact: true`; no CSS class selectors; no `waitForTimeout()`; count asserted before `.nth()`; no `.first()` silencing missing elements; assertions are specific and meaningful (not just `toBeTruthy()`)
- **Fixture usage** — custom fixtures from `base.fixture.ts` used where appropriate; tests using `authenticatedRequest` or `unauthenticatedRequest` import from `@fixtures/api.fixture` (not `@fixtures/base.fixture`); no manual login logic duplicated outside `auth.setup.ts`; imports never come directly from `@playwright/test`
- **Page Object Model conventions** — page classes extend `AbstractPage`; `heading` getter uses `getByRole('heading', { name: ..., exact: true })`; static `url`, `title`, `accessKey` defined; no page-specific logic leaking into test files
- **TypeScript quality** — no `!` non-null assertions on env vars; `page.evaluate()` calls have explicit generic type; no implicit `any`; no unused imports; path aliases used instead of relative imports (`@fixtures/*`, `@pages/*`, `@utils/*`, `@test-data/*`, `@types-local/*`); `tsc --noEmit` passes
- **Potential bugs** — async/await not missing on Playwright calls; no unhandled promise rejections; locators not reused across navigations; any file reading `process.env` credentials calls `loadEnv(import.meta.url, N)` at module top level (missing this passes on CI but fails locally)
- **Flakiness** — no fixed timeouts; animation waits use `requestAnimationFrame`; auth setup asserts login actually succeeded; no assumptions about element order without explicit count assertion
- **Security** — no credentials hardcoded anywhere; `.env` and `bruno/.env` remain gitignored; Bruno dotenv secrets accessed via `{{process.env.VAR}}` / `bru.getProcessEnv()` (not plaintext in `.bru` files); no sensitive data in committed config files (`.actrc`, `playwright.config.ts`, etc.); `ORWELLSTAT_USER`/`ORWELLSTAT_PASSWORD` sourced only from `.env` (local) or GitHub Actions secrets (CI)
- **Formatting** — code is formatted with Prettier (`npm run format` from `playwright/typescript/`); never commit files that would fail `npm run format:check`
- **Test tags** — every test (or its enclosing `test.describe`) must carry exactly one tag: `{ tag: '@smoke' }` for title/heading/HTTP status checks, `{ tag: '@regression' }` for deep content checks (table data, SVG analysis, link hrefs, accessibility, visual); new tests must follow the tag strategy documented in `README.md`
- **Consistency with existing patterns** — new utils and test files documented in `README.md` (including the "Single test file" run list and the spec file description in the Architecture section); new spec files must also appear in the "Test tags" table and carry the appropriate tag; new page files exported via the appropriate `index.ts`; code style matches surrounding files; JSON/config files are valid (no stray braces, no syntax errors)
